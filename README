I've added my unix dotfiles to github at https://github.com/sdt/Dotfiles/

The pattern is that the default ~/.$DOTFILE sources ~/.dotfiles/$DOTFILE, so
that the customisations are all in ~/.dotfiles/$DOTFILE. Further
machine-specific customisations are in an optional file
~/.dotfiles/$DOTFILE.local, which is not committed.

There'a an install.sh script which appends the following lines to the
appropriate system dotfiles. Use at own risk!


Sample usages:
    .bashrc:
        source ~/.dotfiles/bashrc

    .vimrc
        source ~/.dotfiles/vimrc

    .gvimrc
        source ~/.dotfiles/gvimrc


Extra files:

    Fixedsys font - X

        mkdir -p ~/.fonts
        cd ~/.fonts
        wget http://launchpadlibrarian.net/17249874/FSEX300-L.ttf
        sudo fc-cache -f

    Fixedsys font - MacOs

        extract to ~/Library/Fonts

Acknowledgements:

    For my own convenience, I've copied some third-party files into my .dotfiles
    tree. These are listed below. Please contact me if you're not happy about me
    using these.
